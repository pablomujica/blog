My name is Pablo Mujica. I'm an Uruguayan cloud SysAdmin specialized in cloud environments, particularly Azure.

I've been working in the field since 2015, starting in a System Integrator as a Pre-Sales Consultant, where I found my passion for Designing environments, particularly Cloud mixed environment mixing the different capabilities of IaaS, SaaS and PaaS. Then I moved to a Support focused position to eventually land in a Lead System Administrator position in a Windows environment, with the classical organization tools like AD, on-premise SQL, IIS based services but also more varied technologies under the Azure umbrella, including Azure Active Directory, Azure Web Apps, Azure SQL. In this regard, I'm a Certified Azure Administrator Associate.

Currently I'm working Administrating an Azure based financial environment that supports digital transactions in the US market.

The expectations of this space is to collect some of the solutions developed to make my life easier, that being in my work or personal tasks.
